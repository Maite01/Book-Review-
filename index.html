        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>First step: instead of finding it, ask God to show you a will for your life.</p>
        <p>We should simply trust God to guide, lead, reveal and speak to us.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>1. Serve the Lord with Gladness</h2>
        <p><strong>Psalms 100:2</strong></p>
        <blockquote>“Worship the Lord with gladness, come before him with joyful songs.”</blockquote>
        <p>● Philippians 4:11 – Apostle Paul learned to be content in whatever circumstance might be.</p>
        <p>● God uses challenging times to stretch and test our faith (1 Peter 1:6-7). We never know how much faith we have till it’s tested.</p>
        <p>● We learn from God's words and life experiences (Proverbs 3:13).</p>
        <h3>Two Ways to Jumpstart Gladness</h3>
        <p><strong>1. Smile</strong></p>
        <p>A merry heart does good like medicine (Proverbs 17:22)</p>
        <p>● A smile is a frown upside down. Start smiling and let it change your feelings. Smile in the mirror every morning, and you will see a big difference in your life.</p>
        <p><strong>2. Make Melody in Your Heart to the Lord</strong></p>
        <p>Paul instructs us in Ephesians 5:19 to "Speak out to one another in Psalms and hymns and spiritual songs. Offering praise with voices (and instruments) and making melody with all your heart to the Lord."</p>
        <h3>10 Reasons to Be Glad</h3>
        <p>1. Your name is written in heaven — You will spend eternity with the Lord. (Luke 10:20)</p>
        <p>2. You don’t have to live in hatred — God gives you grace to forgive those who hurt you. (Colossians 3:13)</p>
        <p>3. You can maintain a positive attitude in all situations. (Ephesians 4:23)</p>
        <p>4. You can be patient — Impatience only frustrates you, but patience brings peace. (Psalm 37:7)</p>
        <p>5. God is always with you — You are never alone. (Deuteronomy 31:6; Matthew 28:20)</p>
        <p>6. You are loved unconditionally every moment of your life. (Romans 8:35–39)</p>
        <p>7. The Holy Spirit lives in you and helps you anytime you need Him. (Romans 8:11,26–27)</p>
        <p>8. You have basic needs met — a home, food, water, and clothing. (Philippians 4:19)</p>
        <p>9. You can help others — and in doing so, you also receive joy. (Proverbs 11:25)</p>
        <p>10. God works all things together for your good because you love Him and are called according to His purpose. (Romans 8:28)</p>
        <h3>How Our Thoughts Affect Our Journey</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Our thoughts affect every area of our lives, especially our words, attitudes, and actions.</li>
            <li>We can choose thoughts that produce and add to our gladness (Philippians 4:3).</li>
        </ul>
        <p>2 Corinthians 10:4-5 tells us "The weapons we fight with are not the weapons of the world. On the contrary, they have divine powers to demolish arguments and every pretension that sets itself up against the knowledge of God, and we take captive every thought to make it obedient to Christ."</p>
        <p>This passage tells us that we can cast down wrong thoughts and choose thoughts that reflect God's will.</p>

    <section>
        <h2>2. Thank God in Everything</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Give thanks in all circumstances, for this is God's will for you in Christ Jesus. (1 Thessalonians 5:18)</li>
            <li>God's will is for us to give Him thanks in every situation. (1 Corinthians 2:14)</li>
            <li>Growing in spiritual maturity helps us discern what God teaches us to do.</li>
            <li>Complaining is a sin — the Israelites murmured, and God sent serpents into the camp (Numbers 21:6).</li>
            <li>Complaining, murmuring, and finding fault are symptoms of ingratitude.</li>
            <li>Romans 12:2 teaches us that renewing our minds helps us discern God's will.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Release the Power of God in Your Life</h3>
        <p>1 Thessalonians teaches us to be thankful in all circumstances and not quench the Holy Spirit.</p>
        <p>After receiving what we want, we should not forget God.</p>
        <h3>Thanksgiving and Answered Prayers</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Philippians 4:6 teaches us to pray with thanksgiving.</li>
            <li>Are you thankful?</li>
            <li>Do you frequently voice your thanksgiving to God and people who help you?</li>
            <li>The Bible says to be thankful (Psalms 100:4)</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Thanksgiving and Healing</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Thanksgiving protects us from bitterness.</li>
            <li>Thankfulness protects us from jealousy & envy.</li>
            <li>Thankful people feel less stress than those who are disconnected or discontent.</li>
            <li>God's word says that a merry heart does good like medicine (Proverbs 17:22).</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>A Thankful Heart is a Generous Heart</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Being truly thankful provokes a desire to be generous to others.</li>
            <li>A thankful heart promotes generosity, and generosity causes others to be thankful to God.</li>
            <li>See 2 Corinthians 9:7–12 for reference.</li>
            <li>Love is God's will — love God with all your heart, and love others as yourself (Matthew 22:37-40)</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>3. Offer Yourself as a Living Sacrifice</h2>
        <p>Romans 12:1 – Offer yourself to God and live as a personal representative of Jesus.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Offer yourself to God as scripture says.</li>
            <li>Live as a representative of Jesus. Is your confidence in what you do or who you are as God's child?</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Be Available to God's Will</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Offer yourself for God’s use in whatever way He chooses.</li>
            <li>After offering yourself, continue your life in trust and obedience.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>All Means All</h3>
        <p>Present your bodies as a living sacrifice, holy and well-pleasing to God, which is your reasonable service and spiritual worship.</p>
        <p>Are you holding anything back from God? Are you ready to do anything He asks?</p>
        <h3>One Day at a Time</h3>
        <p>Sometimes we focus on what we think God wants, forgetting fellowship and time with Him first. Giving yourself completely to God is a process (James 4:7; Romans 6:13; Galatians 2:20).</p>
        <p>Paul learned to become content in all situations (Philippians 4:11). Learning takes time and requires going through experiences with God’s faithfulness.</p>
        <p>God won't call you to something that makes you miserable. Enjoy the journey.</p>
        <h3>Enjoy The Journey</h3>
        <p>It is important for you to enjoy your journey through life. Jesus said He
came that we might have and enjoy abundant life (John 10:10). Instead of
putting the burden of hearing from God on yourself, trust Him to speak to
you. When He wants to tell you something, He can make sure you hear.
Him.</p>
    <p>God won't call you to do somwthing that nakes you miserable.</p>

      <h2>3.Learn To Follow Your Heart</h2>  
      <ul>
          <li>Trust in the Lord with all your heart and lean not on your own
understanding; in all your ways submit to him, and he will make your
paths straight.
Proverbs 3:5–6 NIV
</li>
<li>To know what God puts in our heart, we must learn to be quiet and still.
Our minds can be filled with many things at once and become quite
confused, so as we seek God’s will, we need to quiet them and see what is
in our heart.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>God looks on the heart</h3>
        <ul>
<li>When you are born again, the Holy Spirit dwells in your heart (spirit).</li>
<li>God’s will is often revealed inside you—not through outward signs but through an inward knowing.</li>
<li>This is why you shouldn’t rely only on logic or feelings; your heart is where God speaks.</li>
     </ul>
<h3>Peace Is the Umpire</h3>
<ul>
<li>Colossians 3:15 teaches us to let peace rule in our hearts.</li>
<li>Joyce compares peace to an umpire in a game—it “calls the shots.”</li>
<li>If you feel peace about a decision, it’s a good sign you’re in God’s will.</li>
<li>If you feel restless, agitated, or uneasy, that’s a warning signal.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Don’t Ignore the Inner Warning</h3>
<li>Many people override their inner caution signs because they want to please others or avoid discomfort.</li>
<li>Joyce stresses the importance of listening to that “red flag” inside, even if you don’t understand it at the time.</li>
<li>Ignoring the Spirit often leads to regret.</li>
<h3>Distinguishing Spirit from Emotions</h3>
     <ul>
<li>Emotions can be loud and pushy, but the Spirit is steady and quiet.</li>
<li>Your heart’s leading won’t change from moment to moment the way emotions do.</li>
<li>That’s why it’s important to wait and test the feeling of peace over time.</li>
</ul>
     <h3>The Word and the Spirit Agree</h3>
     <ul
<li>God will never lead you through your heart in a way that contradicts the Bible.</li>
<li>If what you “feel led” to do goes against Scripture, it’s not God’s will.</li>
<li>The Spirit inside you and the Word of God always confirm each other.</li>
</ul>
    <h3>Practice Daily Obedience</h3>
    <ul>
<li>Learning to follow your heart doesn’t happen overnight—it comes with practice.</li>
<li>Start with small daily decisions (what to say, how to respond, what to prioritize).</li>
<li>The more you obey the inner promptings, the sharper your discernment becomes.</li> 
   </ul>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h2>Take a Step Of Faith</h2>
        <h3>God Requires Faith</h3>
         <ul>
<li>The Bible says “without faith it is impossible to please God” (Hebrews 11:6).</li>
<li>Knowing God’s will is not enough—you must be willing to step out and act on it.</li>
</li>Faith means trusting God even when you don’t have all the details or guarantees.<li>
       </ul>
     <h3>Don’t Be Afraid of Making Mistakes</h3>
    <ul>
<li>Fear of failure keeps many people stuck in the same place.</li>
<li>Joyce teaches that even if you make a mistake, God can redirect you.</li>
<li>Taking no action at all because of fear is worse than moving forward and learning along the way.</li>
      <h3>Faith Is an Action Word</h3>
      <ul>
<li>Faith isn’t just believing in your heart—it shows up in what you do.</li>
<li>Every time you obey God in a small thing, you strengthen your faith for bigger steps.</li>
<li>Joyce encourages starting with small, practical actions that align with what you sense God wants.</li>
    </ul>
<h3>Obedience Brings Clarity</h3>
      <ul>
<li>Sometimes God doesn’t show the full picture until you take the first step.</li>
<li>Like Abraham in the Bible, you may have to move “not knowing exactly where you’re going.”</li>
<li>As you obey step by step, God reveals more of His plan.</li>
     </ul>
      <h3>Trust God’s Character</h3>
       <ul>
<li>The reason we can step out in faith is because God is faithful.<li>
<li>He will not lead you into something that will harm you.</li>
<li>Trust in His goodness and promises gives you the courage to act, even in uncertainty.</li>
      </ul>
